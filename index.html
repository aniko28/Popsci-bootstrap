            <h4>The influenza virus.</h4>
            <p>Finding a cure for viruses like Ebola, Zika, or even the flu is a challenging task. Viruses are vastly
                different from one another, and even the same strain of a virus can mutate and change--that's why
                doctors
                give out a different flu vaccine each year. But a group of researchers at IBM and the Institute of
                Bioengineering and Nanotechnology in Singapore sought to understand what makes all viruses alike. Using
                that
                knowledge, they've come up with a macromolecule that may have the potential to treat multiple types of
                viruses and prevent them from infecting us. The work was published recently in the journal
                <spanc><i>Macromolecules.</i></span>
            </p>
            <p>For their study, the researchers ignored the viruses’ RNA and DNA, which could be key areas to target,
                but
                because they change from virus to virus and also mutate, it’s very difficult to target them
                successfully.</p>
            <p>Instead, the researchers focused on glycoproteins, which sit on the outside of all viruses and attach to
                cells in the body, allowing the viruses to do their dirty work by infecting cells and making us sick.
                Using
                that knowledge, the researchers created a macromolecule, which is basically one giant molecule made of
                smaller subunits. This macromolecule has key factors that are crucial in fighting viruses. First, it’s
                able
                to attract viruses towards itself using electrostatic charges. Once the virus is close, the
                macromolecule
                attaches to the virus and makes the virus unable to attach to healthy cells. Then it neutralizes the
                virus’
                acidity levels, which makes it less able to replicate.</p>
            <p>As an alternative way to fight, the macromolecule also contains a sugar called mannose. This sugar
                attaches
                to healthy immune cells and forces them closer to the virus so that the viral infection can be
                eradicated
                more easily.</p>
            <p>The researchers tested out this treatment in the lab on a few viruses, including Ebola and dengue, and
                they
                found that the molecule did work as they thought it would: According to the paper, the molecules bound
                to
                the glycoproteins on the viruses’ surfaces and reduced the number of viruses. Further, the mannose
                successfully prevented the virus from infecting immune cells.</p>
            <p>This all sounds promising, but the treatment still has a ways to go before it could be used as a
                disinfectant
                or even as a potential pill that we could take to prevent and treat viral infections. But it does
                represent
                a step in the right direction for treating viruses: figuring out what is similar about all viruses to
                create
                a broad spectrum antiviral treatment.</p>
